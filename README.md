Objective
Analyze and visualize pizza sales data to provide insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and business performance.

Project Steps
Data Collection:

Gather sales data from various sources such as POS systems, online orders, and customer feedback.
Example data columns: Order ID, Date, Time, Pizza Type, Size, Quantity, Price, Customer ID, Location, Payment Method.
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
Standardize data formats (e.g., date and time).
Ensure consistency in categorical variables (e.g., pizza types and sizes).
Data Transformation:

Create calculated columns (e.g., Total Sales = Quantity * Price).
Aggregate data to calculate metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer frequency.
Data Loading:

Load cleaned and transformed data into Power BI.
Data Modeling:

Establish relationships between tables (e.g., Orders table linked to Customers and Pizzas tables).
Create hierarchies (e.g., Date hierarchy: Year > Quarter > Month > Day).
Data Visualization:
